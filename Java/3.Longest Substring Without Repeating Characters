Hint
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


Solution:-
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int left =0, right =0, ml =0;
        Set<Character> visit = new HashSet<>();
        while(right < s.length()){
            char cc = s.charAt(right);
            if(visit.contains(cc)){
                visit.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            else{
                visit.add(cc);
                ml=Math.max(ml,right-left+1);
                right++;
            }
        }
        return ml;
    }
}
